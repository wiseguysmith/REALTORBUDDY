# RealtorBuddy Pilot Playbook (Cizar)

## 1. Pilot Objective

Validate that RealtorBuddy saves time and closes more deals for Cizar by automating intake, scoring, follow-up, and analytics.

**Duration**: 60 days

**Goal**: +25% engagement rate, +15% more deals closed, 5–10 hrs saved weekly

**Scope**: WhatsApp + email outreach only (Phase 1)

## 2. Daily Workflow

### Morning (9am)
- Receive Daily Top 5 Leads report via WhatsApp/email
- Review explainability cards ("Hot because budget $350k, moving in 30 days")
- Approve/reject any draft messages for Hot leads

### During the Day
- Check WhatsApp/email automation logs for Warm + Nurture leads
- Attend showings, handle contracts. RealtorBuddy keeps nurture pool engaged

### End of Day
- Log deals advanced/closed in dashboard
- Add notes for any manual leads

## 3. Weekly Workflow

- Review Weekly Engagement Summary (response rates, hours saved)
- Check lost lead reason codes
- Provide feedback:
  - Were the Top 5 actually the right priorities?
  - Did any messages feel "off" or too robotic?

## 4. Feedback Channels

- Slack/WhatsApp group → instant feedback
- Weekly call with dev team → review metrics, address issues
- Pilot survey → structured input every 2 weeks

## 5. Lead Lifecycle Rules (During Pilot)

- **Hot**: Contact every 2 days, draft messages require approval
- **Warm**: Auto-contact weekly, no approval required
- **Nurture**: Auto-contact monthly with content hooks
- **Closed**: Triggers referral request automation
- **Archived**: Marked with reason code (unrealistic, unresponsive, etc.)
- **Recycle**: Reactivated after 90 days

## 6. Cizar's Role

- Approve hot lead drafts
- Give feedback on message tone
- Track whether automation saves time
- Provide deal closure updates (manually, until MLS integration later)

## 7. Dev Team's Role

- Monitor logs for errors
- Adjust scoring weights if engagement seems off
- Handle compliance (opt-outs, audit logs)
- Capture metrics weekly and compare to baseline

## 8. Pilot Success Criteria

- Engagement rate +25%
- Deals closed +15% (vs. baseline)
- Cizar reports ≥5 hrs saved weekly
- At least 1–2 referral requests triggered
