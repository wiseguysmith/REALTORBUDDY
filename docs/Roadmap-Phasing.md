# RealtorBuddy Roadmap & Phasing

## 1. Phase 1: Pilot (0–60 Days)

**Objective**: Prove value with Cizar — validate time savings, deal conversion, and engagement.

✅ **Core Agents**: Intake, Scoring, Follow-Up, Analytics

✅ **Daily Top 5** report via WhatsApp/email

✅ **Explainability cards** for scores

✅ **ROI dashboard** (time saved, deals closed)

✅ **Compliance**: consent-first, opt-outs, audit logs

### 🎯 Success Targets:
- +25% engagement rate
- +15% deals closed
- 5–10 hrs saved weekly

## 2. Phase 2: Growth (90–180 Days)

**Objective**: Expand features, strengthen compliance, prep SaaS launch

🔄 **Scouting Agent v1** (flag-only)

📞 **Voice Agent v1** (Reminder Calls)

📊 **Internal compliance dashboard**

🔎 **Lost lead tracking** + reason codes

🌱 **Referral automation** triggered by closed deals

### 🎯 Targets:
- Full lead lifecycle automation (Hot/Warm/Nurture)
- Scouting surfaces ≥10 new leads/month
- Voice reminders reduce missed showings by 30%

## 3. Phase 3: SaaS Scale (6–12 Months)

**Objective**: Transition from pilot to SaaS-ready product

🌍 **Multi-user roles** (Admin, Agent, Assistant)

📞 **Voice Agent v2** (Pre-Qualifier Calls)

🔒 **User-facing compliance dashboards** (regulator-ready)

🛒 **Modular marketplace hooks** for agents (e.g., "Market Analysis Agent," "Referral Booster Agent")

### 🎯 Targets:
- 50+ active realtor users
- <5% monthly churn
- ≥90% active lead coverage (all leads contacted on time)

## 4. Phase 4: Long-Term Expansion (12–24 Months)

**Objective**: Build moat and extend beyond real estate

🚀 **Horizontal expansion** into adjacent industries (coaches, consultants, car dealerships)

🧠 **Adaptive scoring** (ML-based, learns from feedback)

🌐 **Regional compliance modes** (GDPR/EU, LATAM)

🏪 **Marketplace launch** (agent add-ons, third-party modules)

### 🎯 Targets:
- ARR milestone (set based on SaaS pricing)
- Marketplace >25% of revenue within 2 years
- Expansion into 2 new verticals

## 5. Strategic Anchors

- **Compliance-First SaaS** → differentiator vs. grey-hat tools
- **Daily Ritual Integration** → habit-forming (Top 5 leads each morning)
- **Explainability & Trust Layer** → realtor adoption hinges on transparency
- **Referral Growth Loop** → built-in virality
- **Modular Architecture** → SaaS now, marketplace later
