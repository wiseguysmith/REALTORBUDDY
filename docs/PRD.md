# RealtorBuddy PRD

## 1. Vision & Goals

RealtorBuddy is a compliance-first SaaS platform that automates the most painful parts of real estate lead generation and nurturing: intake, scoring, follow-up, and scouting.

🎯 Goal: Save realtors time, increase closed deals, and provide a structured system that amplifies—not replaces—their human touch.

🧪 Pilot: Start with Cizar, a practicing realtor, to validate workflows and metrics. Use his cadences and qualification model as defaults for the broader SaaS.

🌍 Positioning: Vertical SaaS, built for real estate first. Modular design ensures future expansion into adjacent industries if desired.

## 2. Core Features (MVP)

### Intake Agent
- Manual input + chatbot-style intake
- Structured forms (budget, timeline, motivation, lender status)

### Scoring Agent
- Rules-based weighted scoring with explainability cards
- Hot/Warm/Nurture classification

### Follow-Up Agent
- Hybrid automation:
  - Hot → draft + approve
  - Warm/Cold → auto-send with templates
- WhatsApp + Email channels

### Analytics Agent
- Daily "Top 5 Leads" report via WhatsApp/email
- ROI Dashboard (hours saved, deals closed, revenue impact)
- Lost lead tracking with reason codes

### Scouting Agent (Phase 2)
- V1: Flag-only leads from Zillow, FB, WhatsApp groups
- V2: Opt-in direct contact (grey zone)
- V3: Voice Agent (reminder first, pre-qualifier later)

## 3. 10x Levers (Built-In Differentiators)

1. **Explainability Cards** → "This is hot because budget = $350k, relocating in 30 days, replied within 1hr."
2. **Daily Top 5 via WhatsApp/email** → Habit-forming morning ritual
3. **Referral Automation** → Auto-generates referral request messages for closed deals
4. **ROI Dashboard** → Shows clear value: "8 hrs saved, 2 extra deals this month."
5. **Template Playbooks** → Cizar's cadences + messages as defaults
6. **Content Hooks** → Market stats, financing tips, listing alerts to warm nurture leads

## 4. Lead Lifecycle

### States:
New → Active (Hot/Warm/Nurture) → Closed → Archived → Recycle

### Flows:
- Hot → contacted every 2 days until progress made
- Warm → contacted weekly
- Nurture → monthly contact with hooks
- Closed → success, trigger referral automation
- Archived → lost, logged with reason codes
- Recycle → cold leads re-engaged after 90 days

## 5. Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics:
- Engagement Rate (responses to outreach)
- Number of Deals Closed (pilot baseline vs post-automation)

### Secondary Metrics:
- Hours saved weekly
- Referral rate increase
- Cost per lead vs revenue from closed deals

### Target (Pilot):
- Engagement +25%
- Deals closed +15% in 90 days
- 5–10 hrs saved per week

## 6. Compliance & Safety

- **Consent-first** → Double opt-in for WhatsApp/email
- **Fair Housing Guardrails** → No filtering on protected categories
- **Audit Logs** → Every message, score, and decision logged
- **Opt-outs** → STOP keyword, unsubscribe links
- **Grey-Zone Push** → Scouting agent only flags leads initially; realtor initiates contact manually
- **Data Ownership** → Realtors own their lead data. RealtorBuddy owns platform + anonymized aggregate insights
